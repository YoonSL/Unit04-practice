# Instructions

Drills are an important part of learning any new skill. In this exercise we'll drill some key concepts from the last unit. 

* Begin with a flowchart.

* Individually calculate the sum of each array and render it to the page. 

*Note:* You are separately rendering the sum for each array, *not* the sum of all 5. You should have 5 numbers on your webpage.
