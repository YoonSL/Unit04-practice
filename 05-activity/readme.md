# Instructions

Functions are a vital part of building scalable websites that are easy to maintain. With few exceptions, every function should have an input (parameters) and output (return).

For this assignment, refactor our earlier code using a function that sums an array when it's called.

* Create a function called `addList`

* The function should take in an array of numbers as a parameter and return the sum of all the numbers in that list. 

* Use that function to render the sum of all 5 arrays to the page. 

*Note:* Your webpage should look identical to the way it looked before the refactor.
