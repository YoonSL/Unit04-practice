# Instructions

## Part 1: 
Create a `val()` function in `dom.js` that returns the value property of the first element in the `nodeList`. 

*Hint:* Don't forget to add that to the `publicAPI` object.


## Part 2: 
Add the following code to the function that executes on button click: 

* Use the `val()` function to get the value of the user input. 

* Change the text of the span to match the value of the user input you just captured.
