# Instructions

## Part 1: 

Alter the `val()` function in `dom.js` such that if an argument is passed to it, the value property of the first element in the `nodeList` is set to the argument. Otherwise, the function should return the value property of the first element in the `nodeList`.


## Part 2:

Use this updated `val()` function to reset the value of the input box to be empty after you have captured the user input.
