# Instructions

DOM Manipulation is incredibly common, so we'll spend the next couple classes building a DOM manipulation library with lots of easy to remember functions. We'll start by refactoring the last activity to use a `text` function.

* Create a function called `text`.

* The function should take in 2 parameters:  a string that represents the selector ('.className', '#id', etc) and a string that represents the text you want on the page. 

* The new function should loop through every item in the nodeList and reset the `textContent` property to the new text.

* Use this function to recreate the page as it appeared before.
