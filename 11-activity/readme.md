# Instructions

Using the existing DOM Manipulation functions, in the `app.js` file, add code to change the text of the span with the `.love-hate` class to say "hate" when the mouse is over it and "love" when the mouse is not. 

*Hint:* You'll need to call the `text()` and `on()` functions that are written in `dom.js`. 

*Hint:* Remember the syntax and order of parameters of the `on()` function. 
* The first parameter is the `selector`, some examples being an `h1`, `.class-name`, or `#id-name`. 
* The second parameter is the `action`, like `click` or `mouseenter`. 
* The third parameter is the name of the function that should execute when that action takes place.
